# NYSL-chat-app

This is my first chat app. 
So, in order to create this mobile web app, I visualized my-self as an independent developer that the Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) hired to create an app and give their players and parents an easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules. I added features to the app that are specific to mobile devices, such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.
In order to create a robust and useful mobile web application I used features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application, and I created a responsive design that works for various screen sizes and rotations.
As a first step, I determined what the app was for, by developing typical user personas and likely scenarios where these users could search for the app, and considering what kind of problem theyâ€™re trying to solve. Then I draw a user flow diagram by taking as a reference the screen mockups that I designed. These steps you can find them in the UI file.
I chose as a back-end web server Firebase because it is free for small projects and it provides a way to store and retrieve data using Javascript, so after creating the HTML, CSS, and JS files, I installed Node because Firebase CLI is built using the node scripting system. Then I added functionality with javascript and Vue js with the help of Firebase as a web server, by using its Authentication and Realtime database modules, so that my chat app could be almost a real app for chatting.
Finally, just because I wanted my web app to behave like a native app standalone on iOS and Android I added specials tags to the HTML files and put a bookmark to my web app on the home screen of my mobile device. You will also need to find or create an icon to display on the home screen.
