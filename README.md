# NYSL-chat-app

This is my first chat app. 
So, in order to create this mobile web app, I visualized my-self as an independent developer that the Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL) hired to create an app and give their players and parents an easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules. I added features to the app that are specific to mobile devices, such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.
In order to create a robust and useful mobile web application I used features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application, and I created a responsive design that works for various screen sizes and rotations.
As a first step, I determined what the app was for, by developing typical user personas and likely scenarios where these users could search for the app, and considering what kind of problem they’re trying to solve. Then I draw a user flow diagram by taking as a reference the screen mockups that I designed. These steps you can find them in the UI file.
I chose as a back-end web server Firebase because it is free for small projects and it provides a way to store and retrieve data using Javascript, so after creating the HTML, CSS, and JS files, I installed Node because Firebase CLI is built using the node scripting system. Then I added functionality with javascript and Vue js with the help of Firebase as a web server, by using its Authentication and Realtime database modules, so that my chat app could be almost a real app for chatting.
Finally, just because I wanted my web app to behave like a native app standalone on iOS and Android I added specials tags to the HTML files and put a bookmark to my web app on the home screen of my mobile device. You will also need to find or create an icon to display on the home screen.

🔧 Technologies used:

- Project developed on JavaScript and Firebase modules.
- Firebase as a backend server.
- Front-end developed on HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap v4.1.3, jQuery, JavaScript and Vue.js.
